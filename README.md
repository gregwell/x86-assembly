# x86-assembly

- a collection of files from spring 2019 Computer Architecture course, unfortunately without any description (uploaded for backup purposes, maybe I'll come back here sometime and go back in time)

- all programs are written in 32-bit x86 assembly language (for the x86 family of microprocessors)

- course notes are available at [this link](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/polish/old-school-style-notes/architektury-komputerow.pdf)
